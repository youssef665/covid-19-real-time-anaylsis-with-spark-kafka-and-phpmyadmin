# COVID-19 Real-Time Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project involves the development of a real-time data analysis pipeline for COVID-19 data using Apache Kafka and Apache Spark. The data is ingested in real-time using Kafka, processed and analyzed with Spark, and then managed and visualized with phpMyAdmin.

## Technologies Used
- **Apache Kafka**: Used for data ingestion and real-time streaming.
- **Apache Spark**: Utilized for processing and analyzing large datasets.
- **phpMyAdmin**: Employed for managing and visualizing the data.

## Key Features
- **Real-Time Data Ingestion**: Set up Kafka to ingest real-time data streams related to COVID-19.
- **Data Processing and Analysis**: Implemented Spark to process and analyze the ingested data, providing insights into COVID-19 trends.
- **Data Management and Visualization**: Used phpMyAdmin to manage and visualize the processed data.

## Results
The project successfully processes and analyzes real-time COVID-19 data streams, providing valuable insights into the trends and patterns of the pandemic.
